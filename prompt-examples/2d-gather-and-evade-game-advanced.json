  "name": "2D Gather And Evade Game Advanced",
  "goal": "Create an atmospheric 2D top-down exploration & survival game with the following features:\n\n---\n\nCORE GAMEPLAY:\n\n* Player controls a sprite character viewed from above\n* Movement with WASD keys (support smooth diagonal movement)\n* Hold spacebar for a speed boost\n* Add slight acceleration/deceleration for more \u201cweighty\u201d movement\n* Optional stamina system for boost (stamina bar drains while boosting and slowly refills)\n* Objective: explore, collect food items, and survive as long as possible while avoiding enemies\n* No combat mechanics \u2013 survival through positioning, timing, and smart pathing\n\nWORLD:\n\n* Large, procedurally generated environment (feels bigger than the screen and encourages exploration)\n* Different terrain types (e.g. grass, dirt paths, water edges, rocks) that visually break up the world\n* Some terrain affects movement speed (e.g. mud/slow zones, clear paths that are slightly faster)\n* Obstacles and choke points (trees, rocks, ruins) that create interesting navigation choices\n* Scattered \u201clandmarks\u201d (e.g. ruins, statues, ponds) to help player orient and feel progression\n* Camera follows the player smoothly with a slight look-ahead in the movement direction\n\nCOLLECTIBLES & HAZARDS:\n\n* Multiple types of food items:\n\n  * Basic food: standard score\n  * Rare food: higher score and/or temporary buff (e.g. brief speed boost, reveal nearby food on mini-map)\n* Enemy entities with simple AI:\n\n  * Default behavior: patrol routes or roaming patterns\n  * Detection: when player enters a detection radius or cone, enemy switches to chase mode\n  * After losing sight for a while, enemies return to patrol\n* Optional environmental hazards:\n\n  * Slow zones (e.g. tall grass, shallow water)\n  * Static hazards (e.g. spikes or dangerous plants) that cause damage or instant loss\n* Player has either:\n\n  * One life (instant game over on hit), or\n  * A small health pool with clear visual feedback when damaged\n\nPROGRESSION & GAME LOOP:\n\n* Primary goal: collect as much food as possible before:\n\n  * A global timer ends, or\n  * The player is caught / runs out of health\n* Difficulty scaling over time:\n\n  * More enemies spawn or patrol areas expand\n  * Enemy speed or detection range slowly increases\n* Score system:\n\n  * Points for each collected food item (rarer items worth more)\n  * Optional combo/multiplier for collecting food quickly in succession\n* Clear restart flow: after win/lose, player can restart the run with a single key press\n\nUI ELEMENTS:\n\n* Top-left: continuously updated world coordinates (x, y) of the player\n* HUD elements:\n\n  * Stamina bar for boost (if used)\n  * Health or lives indicator (if used)\n  * Food collected counter\n  * Timer or \u201ctime survived\u201d display\n  * Current score and best score (for replay value)\n* Optional mini-map in a corner:\n\n  * Shows player position\n  * Reveals terrain and landmarks as explored (\u201cfog of war\u201d that clears when visited)\n  * Optionally highlights nearby food/enemies within a limited radius\n* Clear on-screen messages for:\n\n  * Start instructions (\u201cWASD to move, space to boost\u201d)\n  * Important events (combo achieved, rare food collected, almost detected, etc.)\n  * Win/lose summary (\u201cFood collected, time survived, final score\u201d)\n\nVISUAL STYLE:\n\n* 2D top-down sprites for player, enemies, food, and environment tiles\n* Strong visual contrast so player, enemies, and collectibles are instantly distinguishable\n* Simple but expressive animations:\n\n  * Idle and walking animations for player and enemies\n  * Small \u201cbounce\u201d or spin animation when picking up food\n* Soft shadows or drop-shadows under characters to ground them visually\n* Light vignette effect around screen edges to pull attention toward the center\n* Optional day/night or lighting effect:\n\n  * Slightly dimmed world with a light radius around the player\n  * Enemies may be more threatening in darker areas, emphasizing stealth and awareness\n* Particle effects for:\n\n  * Collecting food (small burst)\n  * Taking damage or losing (short, clear feedback)\n\nAUDIO & FEEDBACK (IF SUPPORTED):\n\n* Subtle ambient background loop (exploration vibe)\n* Short sound effects for:\n\n  * Footsteps / movement\n  * Collecting food\n  * Enemy alert / detection\n  * Taking damage, losing, and winning\n* Audio should reinforce feedback without being overwhelming\n\nWIN/LOSE CONDITIONS:\n\n* Win condition example:\n\n  * Collect a target amount of food before the timer expires, or\n  * Reach a specific landmark after collecting a minimum number of items\n* Lose condition:\n\n  * Player is caught by an enemy or health reaches zero\n* On win/lose:\n\n  * Pause gameplay\n  * Show a summary screen with stats:\n\n    * Total food collected\n    * Time survived\n    * Final score and best score\n  * Provide a clear option to restart the game\n\nDELIVERABLE:\n\n* Build this as a single, self-contained, playable application with:\n\n  * Smooth and responsive controls\n  * Clear, readable visuals\n  * Immediate feedback for movement, collection, and danger\n  * A complete loop from start \u2192 play \u2192 win/lose \u2192 restart.",
