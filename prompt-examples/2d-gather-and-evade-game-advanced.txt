Create an atmospheric 2D top-down exploration & survival game with the following features:

---

CORE GAMEPLAY:

* Player controls a sprite character viewed from above
* Movement with WASD keys (support smooth diagonal movement)
* Hold spacebar for a speed boost
* Add slight acceleration/deceleration for more “weighty” movement
* Optional stamina system for boost (stamina bar drains while boosting and slowly refills)
* Objective: explore, collect food items, and survive as long as possible while avoiding enemies
* No combat mechanics – survival through positioning, timing, and smart pathing

WORLD:

* Large, procedurally generated environment (feels bigger than the screen and encourages exploration)
* Different terrain types (e.g. grass, dirt paths, water edges, rocks) that visually break up the world
* Some terrain affects movement speed (e.g. mud/slow zones, clear paths that are slightly faster)
* Obstacles and choke points (trees, rocks, ruins) that create interesting navigation choices
* Scattered “landmarks” (e.g. ruins, statues, ponds) to help player orient and feel progression
* Camera follows the player smoothly with a slight look-ahead in the movement direction

COLLECTIBLES & HAZARDS:

* Multiple types of food items:

  * Basic food: standard score
  * Rare food: higher score and/or temporary buff (e.g. brief speed boost, reveal nearby food on mini-map)
* Enemy entities with simple AI:

  * Default behavior: patrol routes or roaming patterns
  * Detection: when player enters a detection radius or cone, enemy switches to chase mode
  * After losing sight for a while, enemies return to patrol
* Optional environmental hazards:

  * Slow zones (e.g. tall grass, shallow water)
  * Static hazards (e.g. spikes or dangerous plants) that cause damage or instant loss
* Player has either:

  * One life (instant game over on hit), or
  * A small health pool with clear visual feedback when damaged

PROGRESSION & GAME LOOP:

* Primary goal: collect as much food as possible before:

  * A global timer ends, or
  * The player is caught / runs out of health
* Difficulty scaling over time:

  * More enemies spawn or patrol areas expand
  * Enemy speed or detection range slowly increases
* Score system:

  * Points for each collected food item (rarer items worth more)
  * Optional combo/multiplier for collecting food quickly in succession
* Clear restart flow: after win/lose, player can restart the run with a single key press

UI ELEMENTS:

* Top-left: continuously updated world coordinates (x, y) of the player
* HUD elements:

  * Stamina bar for boost (if used)
  * Health or lives indicator (if used)
  * Food collected counter
  * Timer or “time survived” display
  * Current score and best score (for replay value)
* Optional mini-map in a corner:

  * Shows player position
  * Reveals terrain and landmarks as explored (“fog of war” that clears when visited)
  * Optionally highlights nearby food/enemies within a limited radius
* Clear on-screen messages for:

  * Start instructions (“WASD to move, space to boost”)
  * Important events (combo achieved, rare food collected, almost detected, etc.)
  * Win/lose summary (“Food collected, time survived, final score”)

VISUAL STYLE:

* 2D top-down sprites for player, enemies, food, and environment tiles
* Strong visual contrast so player, enemies, and collectibles are instantly distinguishable
* Simple but expressive animations:

  * Idle and walking animations for player and enemies
  * Small “bounce” or spin animation when picking up food
* Soft shadows or drop-shadows under characters to ground them visually
* Light vignette effect around screen edges to pull attention toward the center
* Optional day/night or lighting effect:

  * Slightly dimmed world with a light radius around the player
  * Enemies may be more threatening in darker areas, emphasizing stealth and awareness
* Particle effects for:

  * Collecting food (small burst)
  * Taking damage or losing (short, clear feedback)

AUDIO & FEEDBACK (IF SUPPORTED):

* Subtle ambient background loop (exploration vibe)
* Short sound effects for:

  * Footsteps / movement
  * Collecting food
  * Enemy alert / detection
  * Taking damage, losing, and winning
* Audio should reinforce feedback without being overwhelming

WIN/LOSE CONDITIONS:

* Win condition example:

  * Collect a target amount of food before the timer expires, or
  * Reach a specific landmark after collecting a minimum number of items
* Lose condition:

  * Player is caught by an enemy or health reaches zero
* On win/lose:

  * Pause gameplay
  * Show a summary screen with stats:

    * Total food collected
    * Time survived
    * Final score and best score
  * Provide a clear option to restart the game

DELIVERABLE:

* Build this as a single, self-contained, playable application with:

  * Smooth and responsive controls
  * Clear, readable visuals
  * Immediate feedback for movement, collection, and danger
  * A complete loop from start → play → win/lose → restart.
