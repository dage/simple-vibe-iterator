  "goal": "Your task is to create a visualizer specifically for this song:\nhttps://public-file-hosting-lovely.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/mp3_20251118-200257_439435/fkn_face.mp3\n\nTimeline of major changes\n0:00\u20130:29 \u2013 Stable, mid-level drive (RMS \u224812\u202fk) with no dramatic jumps; this is the intro/build foundation, ideal for establishing the overall color palette and root motion.\n0:29\u20131:00 \u2013 Energy falls to ~6\u20138\u202fk with several short quiet pockets (29.5\u201335\u202fs, 46\u201348\u202fs, 58.5\u201360\u202fs). Those pockets feel like pre-drop atmospheric breaks; use them to shift to minimal visuals or spotlight a single element before the take-off.\n1:00 \u2013 Sharp jump (+8\u202fk) as the first big drop/chorus hits (high-energy windows at 67\u202fs, 69\u202fs, 82\u202fs). This entire 60\u201390\u202fs zone sustains top-tier energy, so throw in fast motion, bright flashes, or layered effects here.\n2:00\u20132:07 \u2013 Deep dip from ~14.5\u202fk to <1\u202fk around 120\u2013123.5\u202fs, immediately restarting with another high-energy surge at 127.5\u202fs (~9.5\u202fk \u2192 14.7\u202fk). Treat this as a dramatic breakdown/resurgence; a sudden quiet frame followed by an explosive reboot suits the music.\n2:52\u20133:00 \u2013 Energy wobbles again (dip at 179\u202fs to ~5\u202fk, back up at 180\u202fs to ~13.5\u202fk). Another release point\u2014good for a contrasting rhythmic or color reset before heading toward the finale.\n4:30\u20134:40 \u2013 Peak energy returns (\u224816\u202fk at 278.5\u202fs). This final surge is the last climax before the outro.\n4:59\u20135:01 \u2013 Energy collapses twice (~300\u202fs down to ~25), so the song winds down into near silence\u2014ideal for letting visuals fade out or freeze.\n\nYou are building a single, self-contained, GPU-accelerated music visualizer.\n\nGOAL\n- Create an \u201cwow effect\u201d realtime visualizer that reacts tightly to music.\n- Prioritize modern, polished visuals, smooth animation, and strong use of GPU acceleration.\n- Result should run interactively on a typical modern laptop.\n\nCORE FEATURES\n- Load and play a music file or accept live audio input from the user.\n- Analyze audio in realtime (frequency spectrum, beat/onset detection, overall loudness).\n- Drive all visual effects from this audio data so it feels clearly synchronized to the music.\n\nVISUAL STYLE\n- Fullscreen experience with a dark background as the base.\n- Modern look: clean shapes, neon/glow, particles, waves, grids, or abstract forms.\n- Depth and parallax if possible (camera motion, layering, scaling).\n- Avoid \u201cretro 90s Winamp clone\u201d look; aim for something that could be used on stage or in a DJ set.\n\nVISUAL MODES\n- Implement at least 3 distinct visual modes (e.g., particle field, waveform/tunnel, geometric shapes).\n- Each mode should respond differently to:\n  - Bass (low frequencies)\n  - Mids and highs\n  - Overall volume and detected beats\n- Add smooth transitions when switching between modes (no hard cuts).\n\nAUDIO REACTIVITY\n- Strong, visible reaction to:\n  - Kick / bass hits (e.g., camera shake, global pulses, scale explosions)\n  - Snare / clap (secondary pulses or color accents)\n  - High-frequency content (sparkles, fine details, or line work)\n- Use both slow, continuous changes (e.g., color gradients tied to average energy)\n  and fast transient reactions (e.g., particles emitting on beats).\n\nINTERACTION & CONTROL\n- Basic controls:\n  - Play / pause music\n  - Switch visual modes\n  - Adjust sensitivity / intensity of reactions\n  - Toggle fullscreen\n- Optional: a simple UI overlay that hides itself automatically after a few seconds of inactivity.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n- Use GPU acceleration for all heavy rendering work.\n- Maintain smooth animation at a high frame rate if possible.\n- Avoid unnecessary allocations and expensive CPU-side work in the main loop.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS\n- You choose the exact libraries, APIs, and architecture.\n- Do NOT explain frameworks or versions in detail; just implement with sensible defaults.\n- Keep the code organized and readable so it can be extended with more modes later.\n\nDELIVERABLE\n- A single, runnable application.\n- Clear instructions at the top of the main file on how to start it and how to provide a music file.\n- Default configuration that works out-of-the-box without extra setup.\n\nNow, implement this visualizer step by step, focusing on audio analysis quality, visual polish, and smooth performance.",
