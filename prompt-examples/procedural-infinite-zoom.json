  "name": "Procedural Infinite Zoom",
  "goal": "Generate a single-file HTML/JavaScript demo implementing a seamless, procedural infinite zoom effect using a two-layer crossfade approach. The effect zooms into a rotated rectangular target area within the current view. To prevent visible edges during the transition, the upcoming high-resolution layer must be generated using \"Overscan Sampling\"—creating a bitmap significantly larger than the viewport so its hard edges are pushed off-screen during the crossfade. Core implementation steps: Setup two canvas layers (Layer_Current bottom visible, Layer_Next top initially transparent). Load high-res base image into Layer_Current. Define target zoom area centered but rotated (15 degrees) relative to current view. Generate Layer_Next with 1.5x overscan factor, sample wider margin around target area, pre-transform (scale down and rotate) to overlay target perfectly. Animation loop applies exponential scaling/rotation to both layers centered on viewport. Crossfade Layer_Next opacity from 0.0 to 1.0 as zoom progresses from 1x to 2x threshold. Reset cycle when Layer_Next reaches 100% opacity: becomes new Layer_Current, reset zoom to 1.0, generate new high-res Layer_Next for seamless infinite loop.",
